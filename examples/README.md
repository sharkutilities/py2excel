<div align = "justify">

A set of simple functions which was collected from different sources and is added as an example to
reproduce Python based in-built functions. These are not developed in VB Script as either the same
is not compatible or simple enough.

## String Functions

A set of functions related to strings. By default, the in-built string functions in Python are
typically accessed using `"my long string".function()` format, however the same is called/developed
using native excel functions.

    `=ISNUMBER(SEARCH("string to search", "reference"))`
