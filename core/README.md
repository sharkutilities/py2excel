Microsoft Excel (MS-Excel) provides a wide variety of useful functions with extensive features. However, (Alas! Microsoft) typical
query syntax is not synced between different products. For example, what works in MS Excel's formula bar may not work within the
Power Query formula window (though they are the same thing) and is again different from the VB script (within a macro enabled workbook)
where the formula are again different.

This section captures different types of formula.
